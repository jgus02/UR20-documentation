   abstract = {In view of the low efficiency in traditional palletizing robot problem of poor control precision, this paper introduces fuzzy PID position control algorithm, based on the actual operation situation of palletizing robot; determined as palletizing robot FPGA hardware platform, hardware platform based on this fuzzy PID position control algorithm is applied to implement palletizing robot motion control system design. The simulation model of fuzzy PID motion control was established by MATLAB software for testing to determine that the fuzzy PID position control algorithm reflects the time quickly in the motion control of palletizing robot, and the actual overshooting is small, which is more suitable for the motion control algorithm of palletizing robot. Under this condition, the modular method is adopted to complete the system application design on the FPGA hardware platform.},

   abstract = {In today's competitive industry marketplace, the companies face growing demands to improve process efficiencies, comply with environmental regulations, and meet corporate financial objectives. Given the increasing age of many industrial systems and the dynamic industrial manufacturing market, intelligent and low-cost industrial automation systems are required to improve the productivity and efficiency of such systems. The collaborative nature of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) brings several advantages over traditional wired industrial monitoring and control systems, including self-organization, rapid deployment, flexibility, and inherent intelligent-processing capability. In this regard, IWSN plays a vital role in creating a highly reliable and self-healing industrial system that rapidly responds to real-time events with appropriate actions. In this paper, first, technical challenges and design principles are introduced in terms of hardware development, system architectures and protocols, and software development. Specifically, radio technologies, energy-harvesting techniques, and cross-layer design for IWSNs have been discussed. In addition, IWSN standards are presented for the system owners, who plan to utilize new IWSN technologies for industrial automation applications. In this paper, our aim is to provide a contemporary look at the current state of the art in IWSNs and discuss the still-open research issues in this field and, hence, to make the decision-making process more effective and direct.

@article{Abdullah2022,
   abstract = {Various aspects of the human workplace have been influenced by robotics due to its precision and accessibility. Nowadays, industrial activities have become more automated, increasing efficiency while reducing the production time, human labor, and risks involved. With time, electronic technology has advanced, and the ultimate goal of such technological advances is to make robotic systems as human-like as possible. As a result of this blessing of technological advances, robots will perform jobs far more efficiently than humans in challenging situations. In this paper, an automatic computer vision-based robotic gripper has been built that can select and arrange objects to complete various tasks. This study utilizes the image processing methodology of the PixyCMU camera sensor to distinguish multiple objects according to their distinct colors (red, yellow, and green). Next, a preprogrammed command is generated in the robotic arm to pick the item employing Arduino Mega and four MG996R servo motors. Finally, the device releases the object according to its color behind the fixed positions of the robotic arm to a specific place. The proposed system can also detect objects' geometrical shapes (circle, triangle, square, rectangle, pentagon, and star) and sizes (large, medium, and small) by utilizing OpenCV image processing libraries in Python language. Empirical results demonstrate that the designed robotic arm detects colored objects with 80\% accuracy. It performs an excellent size and shapes recognition precision in real-time with 100\% accuracy.},

   abstract = {Energy saving in palletizing robot is a fundamental problem in the field of industrial robots. However, the palletizing robot often suffers from the problems of high energy consumption and lacking flexibility. In this work, we introduce a novel differential evolution algorithm to address the adverse effects caused by the instability of the initial trajectory parameters while reducing the energy. Specially, a simplified analytical model of the palletizing robot is firstly developed. Then, the simplified analytical model and the differential evolutionary algorithm are combined to form a planner with the goal of reducing energy consumption. The energy saving planner optimizes the initial parameters of the trajectories collected by the bionic demonstration system, which in turn enables a reduction in the operating power consumption of the palletizing robot. The major novelty of this article is the use of a differential evolutionary algorithm that can save the energy consumption as well as boosting its flexibility. Comparing with the traditional algorithms, the proposed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance. Simulated and actual experimental results illustrate that the optimized trajectory parameters can effectively reduce the energy consumption of palletizing robot by 16%.},
