The objective of this project is to enhance the capabilities of an RV8 robot work cell by integrating various component
, including an end-effector (gripper), a laser safety scanner, emergency stop (E-stop) switches, a MELSEC PLC controller
, a host PC, and a linear rail. The integration aims to facilitate advanced control applications such as pick and place,
palletizing, and depalletizing while ensuring compliance with safety standards.
Currently, the work cell lacks the necessary components and configurations to operate efficiently and safely in a
dynamic environment. The project will focus on developing a robust control application that not only enables the desired
robotic operations but also incorporates critical safety features, including safety cutoffs and direct entry presence
detection. This integration is vital to minimize operational risks and enhance productivity within the work cell.By
addressing these goals, the project aims to transform the RV8 robot work cell into a highly capable, safe, and efficient
automated solution for industrial applications
