The Mitsubishi Rv8-CRL robot is an 8axis robotic system with 6 main joints and 2 additional axes has been chosen for the is project. its payload capacity of 8 kg makes it suitable for the task at hand. the goal is to program the robot to demonstrate how 
industrial robots are utilized in industry, specifically for palletizing transportation cargo.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Rotational Axes: the robots rotational axes allow for precise motion and coordination
    \item Versatility: with its 8 axis composition the robot offers freedom and flexibility in its actions 
    \item Third item
    \item Safety Sensors: the robot is equipped with integrated inductive sensors along its liner rail. These sensors identify end points and enhance safety
    \item 	Emergency Stop Buttons: an additional sensor ensures protection by allowing the robot to halt its movements instantly to prevent injuries
    \item Programming Sequences: the RV-8CRL robots programming involves a predefined sequence of stages. it calibrates itself, moves its joint according to the program
    \item Linear rail(7th axis ): the linear rail enables the robot to move more precisely and perform the required tasked
\end{itemize}
