The transition to smart manufacturing presents significant challenges that hinder the full realization of its potential
benefits. Smart manufacturing relies on the integration of advanced technologies, such as IoT, artificial intelligence
and data analytics, to optimize production processes, enhance flexibility, and improve overall efficiency. However,
many manufacturers struggle with issues such as legacy systems, data silos, insufficient workforce training, and
cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
These challenges result in suboptimal production performance, increased downtime, and higher operational costs,
ultimately impacting competitiveness in a rapidly evolving market. There is a pressing need to identify and address the
barriers to implementing smart manufacturing solutions effectively.
