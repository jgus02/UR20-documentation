This proposal will be focusing on the RV8, although it is possible that the project will switch to the UR20 if it arrives on time.

The source of funding for this project is the CSE department, with no other sources of support known.

The RV8, more specifically RV-8CRL-D, already has the necessary safety scanners, PLC setup, and linear rail. However, a gripper will need to be purchased or designed in order for it to perform a palletizing application. A few options for the gripper will be outlined below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item For palletizing, it is likely that a suction grip will be the most effective. However, those grips can be extremely expensive, likely coming in at a minimum of \$2000 unless used parts can be found. This is due to the necessity of a vacuum generator attached before the actual gripper in order to provide it power.
    \item Some more light-weight grippers have been designed for other robots such as MyCobot, and may be translateable to our robot. This would cost only \$400, and should be explored by reaching out to those manufacturers for questions.
    \item We could also, as the most time-consuming option, take inspiration from existing designs of vacuum pumps or end effectors and design one of the components, using the remaining money to invest in the other component. 
\end{itemize}

The most likely option will be to modify a vacuum gripper intended for another robot arm, create an end effector that will work with a vacuum pump, or to go with another type of gripper entirely.

Additionally, since we are palletizing, some kind of conveyor belt is likely going to be expected. However, such a thing should be relatively simple to make or to avoid, by creating it ourselves or simply placing the boxes in a repeatable manner around the RV8.

\subsection{Preliminary Budget}
This table assumes we will purchase cheap versions of the above options instead of making them ourselves.

\subsection{Current \& Pending Support}
This project's funding currently consists of only the default \$800 funding from the department. More funding may be provided with sufficient justification, but no other funding sources are currently known.
