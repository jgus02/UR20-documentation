The stakeholders in this project are Dr. McMurrough as the sponsor and the undergraduates working on its completion. The undergraduates are two Computer Engineering majors, Luis Contreras and Jasper Gustafson, as well as two Computer Science majors, Christopher Gonzales and Joshua Dominguez.The main point of contact with Dr. McMurrough will be through Luis Contreras.Luis Contreras and Jasper Gustafson will be responsible for the hardware. This will include determining appropriate parts and necessary accessories, connecting those parts to the existing robot, and programming interfaces to enable control of the robot through the wired connections. Christopher Gonzalez and Joshua Dominguez will be responsible for the software. This will include programming behavior of the robot, including the linear rail, in combination with the palletizing algorithm.

The scrum master and speaker during presentations will rotate weekly, with one person having full control during their week. The rotation of these presentations is planned to be in the following order: Luis Contreras, Jasper Gustafson, Christopher Gonzalez, Joshua Dominguez. This order may change if someone wishes to switch their week.
