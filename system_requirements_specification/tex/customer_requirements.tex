This section outlines the customer requirements for the UR20 robotic arm to palletize uniform sized boxes, each marked with a QR code containing box dimensions. The porject also includes the design and implementation of a custom robotic gripper that incorporates bellow suction cups to handle the boxes effectivelty. The robot arm will maintain full functionality in scanning the QR code and locating the box, picking it up and placing on a pallet. 
\subsection{Box Palletizing by UR20 Robot}
\subsubsection{Description}
The UR20 will be used to palletize boxes based on model 1 QR codes, process data, and stack boxes in an effective manner. The system will handle boxes of the same size, ensuring precise and efficient stacking.
