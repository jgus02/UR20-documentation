\subsection{Force adjustment according to dynamic item weight}
\subsubsection{Description}
The collaborative robot will adjust the force it uses dynamically according to the weight of the item, as opposed to assuming a uniform weight for all items.
\subsubsection{Source}
International Organization for Standardization
\subsubsection{Constraints}
Judging the weight of the item would be difficult, and somewhat out of scope for this project. A weighing system would have to be implemented, either negatively accounting for weight leaving the conveyor belt or implemented directly in the robot arm itself.
\subsubsection{Standards}
ISO/TS 15066:2016 and ISO 10218-1:2011
\subsubsection{Priority}

\subsection{Depallatizing aplication of the UR20}
\subsubsection{Description}
The collaborative robot will implement a Depalletizing application with the same hardware. The addition would be using computer vision to detect the boxes and the approach to deputizing.

\subsubsection{Constraints}
Computer vision and the ability to decide the order in which boxes were placed prior will be difficult to implement, given the time Constraints.
